> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Rust port is now in progress** on the [`dev/rust`](https://github.com/instructkr/claw-code/tree/dev/rust) branch and is expected to be merged into main today. The Rust implementation aims to deliver a faster, memory-safe harness runtime. Stay tuned — this will be the definitive version of the project.

## Overview

Project Claw Code is a clean-room Python rewrite that captures the architectural patterns of agent harnesses. **We have successfully updated this project to work with any model from OpenRouter, rather than being restricted to Anthropic models.** 

## Porting Status

The main source tree is now Python-first.

- `src/` contains the active Python porting workspace
- `tests/` verifies the current Python workspace

The current Python workspace is not yet a complete one-to-one replacement for the original system, but the primary implementation surface is now Python.

```

## Python Workspace Overview

The new Python `src/` tree currently provides:

- **`port_manifest.py`** — summarizes the current Python workspace structure
- **`models.py`** — dataclasses for subsystems, modules, and backlog state
- **`commands.py`** — Python-side command port metadata
- **`tools.py`** — Python-side tool port metadata
- **`query_engine.py`** — renders a Python porting summary from the active workspace
- **`main.py`** — a CLI entrypoint for manifest and summary output

## Quickstart

Render the Python porting summary:

```bash
python3 -m src.main summary
```

Print the current Python workspace manifest:

```bash
python3 -m src.main manifest
```

List the current Python modules:

```bash
python3 -m src.main subsystems --limit 16
```

Run verification:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Inspect mirrored command/tool inventories:

```bash
python3 -m src.main commands --limit 10
python3 -m src.main tools --limit 10
```
